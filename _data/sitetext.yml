        desc: "I fondly remember my first Hello World. I was a Junior in Highschool, and I took a class called Intro To Programming. Before that point I had fiddled around with some tech at home and I was interested. In that class I got to write my first Hello World on some old XP computers using Visual C++, not even Visual Studio. Needless to say I was hooked ever since"

        desc: "After I got my hands a little dirty with C++ I discovered a neat little game called Minecraft. I was hooked at first sight, and before long I was playing it nonstop. I wanted to know what it was written in, and that was my first brush with java. I then got ankle-deep in the Minecraft modding community and the rest is history."
